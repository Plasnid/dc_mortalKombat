# dc_mortalKombat
mortalCombat!!!!!!!

To run mortalkombat, use include to add your fighters of choice.  Make a new instance of each fighter and add them to the arena in index.ts.

The arena takes 2 fighters per match.

Once your fighters have been added to the arena in index.ts, run the following command, "npm run build".

The match can then be seen in dist/index.html

Cheers and enjoy!
